**ðŸ‘ˆ I will fix it. I promise...**

This is a simple redis implementation written in Go.
It is developed for only for educational purposes and not supposed to be used in real world projects.

The main goal of this project is to implement complicated parts of redis mainly persistence and replication.

- [ ] Replication

## Building & Running

**Make**

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/burenotti/redis_impl.git
cd redis_impl

# Build server using make
make build

# Run server
./build/redis_liunx_amd64 -config <path_to_config>
```

**Docker**

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/burenotti/redis_impl.git
cd redis_impl

# Build docker image
docker build -t burenotti/redis .

# Run built image 
docker run -v ./config.yaml:/etc/redis/config.yaml -it -p 6379:6379 burenotti/redis_impl
```

## Configuring

This implementation is configured using yaml file, that is passed to server using `-config` parameter.

```redis
bind 127.0.0.1
port 8379
shutdown_timeout 5
```
